The MG4 has quickly become one of the most talked-about electric vehicles in the affordable EV market. With its sleek hatchback design, competitive range, and attractive pricing, it’s no wonder the MG4 is popular in Europe and beyond. However, like any new model, it hasn’t been without its fair share of issues.

If you’re considering buying an MG4 — or already own one — here’s what you need to know about the most common problems being reported in 2024 and 2025.

## ⚠️ 1. Software Glitches and Infotainment Bugs

Many MG4 owners have reported issues with the car’s software — particularly the infotainment system. Common complaints include:

- Random reboots of the screen
- Navigation freezing mid-route
- Delayed or unresponsive touch inputs
- Bluetooth connectivity issues

MG has released several over-the-air (OTA) updates to address these problems, but some users still experience inconsistencies.

**Tip:** Always check for available software updates and install them as soon as possible.

## ⚙️ 2. Regenerative Braking Sensitivity

Another recurring complaint is the **aggressiveness of the regenerative braking system**, especially when driving at low speeds. Some drivers describe the braking as jerky or inconsistent in stop-and-go traffic, making for an uncomfortable ride.

While this is partly due to personal preference, it’s something to test thoroughly during a test drive. In newer firmware versions, MG has allowed more adjustability, which helps.

## 🔋 3. Range Discrepancy in Real-World Driving

On paper, the MG4 boasts a solid range of over 280 miles (WLTP). But real-world performance often falls short of expectations, especially in cold climates or highway driving. Owners commonly report a **15–20% lower range than advertised**, depending on conditions.

This isn’t unusual for EVs, but the gap feels wider compared to rivals like the Hyundai Kona Electric or VW ID.3.

## 🔌 4. Charging Port and Cable Compatibility

Some MG4 users have faced challenges when using certain public charging networks. The main issues include:

- Incompatibility with some Type 2 chargers
- Occasional charging interruptions
- The port door failing to open/close properly

These problems can often be solved with a simple reset or software update, but they can be frustrating during longer trips.

---

## 🚧 5. Build Quality Concerns

MG has made big improvements in manufacturing, but a few build quality concerns still pop up:

- Misaligned panels or trim
- Rattling sounds from the dashboard or doors
- Low-quality cabin materials compared to premium rivals

None of these are deal-breakers at this price point, but it’s worth doing a full pre-delivery inspection if you’re buying new.

---

## 👨‍🔧 6. After-Sales Support and Service Delays

As MG grows rapidly, some owners report long waiting times for parts and limited dealership support. This can be an issue for warranty claims or minor repairs, especially in smaller markets.

If you live in a region with fewer MG service centers, this is something to consider seriously.

## ✅ Final Thoughts

The MG4 delivers great value for its price — but it’s not perfect. While most of the issues are relatively minor or fixable through software updates, they can add up and affect the overall ownership experience.

**Would we still recommend the MG4?** Yes — but with a clear understanding of its limitations. It's a solid EV choice for budget-conscious buyers who prioritize design, range, and features over brand prestige.

Before purchasing, always:

- Take a long test drive.
- Confirm latest software version is installed.
- Ask about service support in your area.

With realistic expectations and regular updates, the MG4 can be a great companion in your electric journey. ⚡
