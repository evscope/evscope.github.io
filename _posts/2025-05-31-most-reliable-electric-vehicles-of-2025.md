Electric vehicles (EVs) are no longer a futuristic fantasy — they’re today’s reality. But as more drivers make the switch to electric, one question keeps rising to the top: **Which EVs are actually reliable in the long run?**

In 2025, *Consumer Reports* published its annual reliability ratings for electric vehicles sold in the U.S. The findings are insightful, sometimes surprising, and — depending on how much you care about maintenance costs — possibly decisive in your next purchase decision.

## ✅ Why Reliability Still Matters

While EVs tend to have fewer moving parts than gas-powered vehicles, reliability is still a major concern. Why? Because when something does break — be it a battery, infotainment system, or drive unit — repairs can be **expensive and time-consuming**, especially if your vehicle is out of warranty.

With this in mind, *Consumer Reports* collected ownership data, service reports, and repair trends to calculate a reliability score for each major EV on the market in 2025.

## 💬 Reality Check: What Reliability Doesn't Tell You

While *Consumer Reports* focuses solely on long-term dependability, **it doesn’t always reflect driving experience, charging speed, or range**. For instance:

- The **Lexus RZ** ranks highly for reliability but only delivers ~176 miles of real-world highway range — significantly less than rivals.
- The **Kia Niro EV**, despite good scores, is criticized for its dated design and underwhelming performance.
- On the flip side, the **Hyundai IONIQ 6** and **Tesla Model 3** offer faster charging and better efficiency but rank lower in reliability due to minor service issues.

This is why it's essential to **balance reliability with performance, range, charging network access, and ownership costs**.

## ⚖️ Should You Buy an EV in 2025?

The electric vehicle market is stabilizing. Incentives are still generous in many regions, and the number of public fast chargers is growing every month. But resale value remains volatile, especially with rapid tech advancements and software updates that make last year’s EV feel outdated.

If you:

- Want to drive your next car for **5–10 years**, and
- Can live with occasional charging inconveniences,

Then 2025 is a smart year to go electric.

On the other hand, if you're uncertain about your long-term needs or just want to "test the waters," leasing may be the safer financial move. Battery tech and range are improving quickly, and a newer, better model might be just two years away.

## 🚗 Final Thoughts

Reliability should always be part of your buying criteria — **but not the only one**. Many of the top EVs on this list will serve you well for years, while others may shine in other areas like driving feel, software, or infrastructure support.

As always, **do your homework**: test drive, research, and think about how you’ll use the vehicle. A city commuter’s perfect EV might be a road tripper’s nightmare.

And remember: an EV is only as good as its charging plan. ⚡
